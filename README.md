# Show Analysis

In this project I've decided to scrape reviews for movies and series (along with movies/series general info) from popular online database of information related to movies and television series.  

Here is the plan of what I'm going to do:

1. [Parsing web-pages](https://github.com/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/blob/main/shows_analysis/parsing_pages/) to collect the datasets
2. Building ML applications:
   1. Sentiment analysis of show reviews
      1. [Baseline: Logistic Regression + TF-IDF](https://nbviewer.org/github/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/blob/main/shows_analysis/notebooks/analysis/3_sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis_baseline.ipynb)
      2. Pretrained models
         1. Dostoevsky
   2. Recommendation system
3. Data Analytics
   1. [Research on the quality of localization of movie titles](https://github.com/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/tree/main/shows_analysis/notebooks/analysis/1_title_localization_analysis)
