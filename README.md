# Show Analysis

1. [Scraping data](https://github.com/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/blob/main/shows_analysis/parsing_pages/)
2. [Research on the quality of localization of movie titles](https://github.com/Extremesarova/shows_analysis/tree/main/shows_analysis/notebooks/analysis/1_title_localization_analysis)  
The goal of this research is to find out:
   * How similar Russian titles and original titles are in general?
   * Can we split dissimilar pairs (Russian title::original title) into groups by root cause?
