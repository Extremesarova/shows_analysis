# Sentiment analysis

The goal of this analysis is to:

* Get hands-on experience with packages and tools for analyzing Russian language (natasha, nltk, spacy, rnnmorph, pymorphy2)
* Investigate available pre-trained models for Russian language (wor2vec, fasttext, navec, models from sber, deeppavlov and others)
* Learn how to finetune BERT-like models
